There is an incredible wealth of open-source DevOps tools available today, all
with their own growing communities. With the recent surge in popularity of command
line centric open source, a wave of newcomers are working with the UNIX command
line for the first time. Patterns that were long only the territory of hackers are
being optioned by the folks who have learned development from a media first
perspective. There is an incredible opportunity to normalize and grow the patterns
we use to build things.  The problem is that into order to utilize all of this
goodness you need an awful lot of background knowledge to get to the point where
it works effectively. StackStrap seeks to mitigate these issues.

StackStrap is decentralized in nature and could be described as a [PaaS] that
companies can run for themselves. The project aims to simplify the process of
building and deploying web based applications and services using existing
open-source. By building up around existing projects StackStrap becomes little
more than an evolving strategy. The project is geared towards smaller operations
which employ a wide range of skill levels and may not be able to afford in house
developer operations. The idea is to offer the simplicities of PaaS services
that work to simplify the process of utilizing clould while allowing companies
to leverage the costs savings of wholesale cloud.

Ultimately StackStrap is a strategy for utilizing some of the greatest automation
innovations that have been offered to the modern web development community.  It
revolves around the idea that the core of a project well suited for rapid and
collaborative development is little more than a specifically laid out tree of
files containing meta-data to describe and coordinate these automation tools in a
way that "just works". Teams should be enabled to learn a short list of simple
commands that enable clear objectives.  This will allow them to utilize simple
work-flows that offer well defined structure so they can spend more time writing
code while worrying less about low level details about the environment that they
will run in.
